## What is this framework about?

The main idea is that this is a utility class framework that relies heavily on custom properties. It's a starting point for you and is not expected to do everything. If there is any issues or it's missing something that you think it needs, create an issue in the git repo or fix it yourself and do a pull request.

## How to use it

In the simplest of explainations, just slap a class on an element that you want to style. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
